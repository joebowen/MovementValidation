Welcome to Hodgkin Huxley NeuroML/LEMS Tutorial
===============================================

This tutorial demonstrates a side-by-side comparison of Python code that runs the `Hodgkin-Huxley equations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin%E2%80%93Huxley_model>`_ and generates plots with a `NeuroML2 implementation <http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fninf.2014.00079/abstract>`_ of the same equations.

This was originally created by @joebowen on behalf of the OpenWorm project.
